// adding style attr for the element

// remember this CSS will be on the top as it is inline and will never be able to be overwritten

//JSX Javascript
//initialize the const variables that could be passed in
//access them with {}
// must return a value, cannot be an expression must be a statement
// const Title = (props) => {
//   console.log(props);
//   return <h1>{title}</h1>;
